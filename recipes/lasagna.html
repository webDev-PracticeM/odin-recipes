        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients</li>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic
                in a pot over medium heat until browned.</li>
            <li>Add and stir to the pot of cooked ground beef the  crushed tomatoes,
                tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons
                of parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon of salt, Italian seasoning, 
                fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer (covered) for 1 1/2 hours,
                stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles
                in boiling water for 8-10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
            </li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons
                of parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch
                baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of
                the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.
                Spoon 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup 
                Parmesan cheese. 
            </li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or 
                make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 
                an additional 25 minutes.
